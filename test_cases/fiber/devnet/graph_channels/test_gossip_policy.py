"""Integration tests for fiber PR #1263.

PR #1263 — *Add gossip ban and rate limit policy*.

Background
----------
Adds ``FiberConfig.gossip_policy`` (``GossipPolicyConfig``) wiring an inbound
gossip rate-limiter + ban tracker into the fiber network actor:

* ``ban``: peers accumulate ``score`` on each ``GossipViolation``; once
  ``score >= threshold`` the peer is disconnected and rejected for the next
  ``duration_ms``. Peers with at least one active channel are NOT
  disconnected (only scored).
* ``inbound_channel_update``: token-bucket rate-limiter keyed by
  ``(peer, outpoint, direction)`` for ChannelUpdate gossip messages. After
  ``burst`` updates in ``interval_ms`` the limiter rejects further updates
  from that key.
* ``outbound_global`` / ``outbound_peer``: token-bucket rate-limit outbound
  gossip bytes; overflow goes to ``outbound_delay_queue_capacity``.
* Deferred ChannelAnnouncement: announcements whose funding tx is not yet
  visible locally are buffered rather than treated as invalid gossip
  (no ban).

The ``gossip_policy:`` block is loadable from the config file only — it is
not exposed via CLI flags or env vars. The dev_config_3 template the
framework renders does not include it; tests below inject it by patching
the rendered ``config.yml`` between ``prepare()`` and ``start()``.

What is observable from Python integration tests
------------------------------------------------
The Python layer can directly drive:
* ``open_channel`` / ``update_channel`` (broadcasts a ChannelUpdate).
* ``graph_channels`` on a peer (shows the latest accepted ChannelUpdate for
  each direction).

Hence we test:
1. Default ``gossip_policy`` doesn't break boot.
2. Custom ``gossip_policy`` block under ``fiber:`` is accepted by the parser.
3. Inbound ChannelUpdate rate-limit: with a very small ``burst`` override,
   spamming ``update_channel`` from one peer causes the receiver's graph to
   stop reflecting later fee rates.

Behaviors that require injecting invalid gossip (ban tracker scoring,
disconnect on threshold, deferred-announcement path) need internal hooks
not exposed via JSON-RPC, so they are not covered here.
