"""Regression test for fiber PR #1335 — scenario F.1.

Multi-channel same-payment_hash mixed state:
- Two parallel channels fiber1 <-> fiber2, one channel fiber2 -> fiber3.
- MPP payment splits across both fiber1 <-> fiber2 channels.
- fiber1 force-closes one of the upstream channels while both TLCs are
  still in flight.
- fiber3 settles the invoice off-chain.

Expected:
- The surviving channel's TLC is fulfilled off-chain (preimage propagates
  back to fiber1).
- The force-closed channel's on-chain received-HTLC output is later
  spent by fiber2's watchtower using the *retained* preimage (the PR-1335
  fix). Without the fix, fiber2 would have dropped the preimage after the
  off-chain split was fulfilled and the on-chain cell would stay locked.
